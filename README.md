# ReasonML Async Fetch API Demonstration

## Summary
This is a demonstration of async requests in ReasonML through interop with the JS fetch API. `npm build` compiles the GetPrice.re module to the file GetPrice.bs.js you can then run the generated JavaScript code by doing.
`node src/GetPrice.bs.js`

The advantage here is that the call is completely type safe.

# Build
